# Incident: basement toilet backs up, regurgitates sewage

**26 May 2023**
- We noticed the basement toilet was overflowing, spilling water onto the concrete floor. 
  The water smelled bad (but not horrendously bad), and there was sewage in the toilet bowl. 
  We had been using the 1st floor toilet at the time.
- I turned off the valve that supplies water to the toilet to stop it from filling, and mopped up the dirty water. 
  I then emptied a bottle of unclogging solution into the toilet.
- After 15-30 minutes, the water level in the toilet had gone down, and the basement toilet seemed to be flushing again. 
  I noticed that flushing the first floor toilet caused rhythmic dripping / thumping sounds in the open pipe that 
  I believe to be the toilet vent pipe.
- We spoke to the on-call plumber at 128 PHCE, who said he thought that we were safe to leave the house for the weekend, 
  given that we had turned off the water. He said he couldnâ€™t say for sure what would cause this without seeing it himself, 
  but mentioned that it seemed likely that it was a matter of bad plumbing design, or an obstruction in the sewer pipe. 
  He mentioned that the house being very old might have a role.

**28 May 2023**
- We returned home and used the first floor bathroom. There was no visible activity in the basement toilet, 
  but we noted that the open pipe (which we believe to be the toilet vent pipe) was making the rhythmic dripping/thumping sounds, 
  previously noted.
- Because one of us was using the first floor bathroom, the other of us used the second floor bathroom, which then became clogged. 
- The clog was slightly surprising, but we noted that too much toilet paper could have been used.
- We then set up an experiment and observed that flushing the toilets on the first and second floors 
  could cause the basement toilet to fill up.
- Later in the evening, we took a shower. That seemed to trigger another basement toilet overflow, despite the toilet fill valve being off. 
  The water did not smell. This seemed like more evidence that the water originated from the shower. 
- We realized that the original overflow event may have been caused by our showering (in full or in part) as well.
- We now think that something is causing the basement toilet to back up every time too much water is introduced into the plumbing system, 
  whether by toilet or shower.
