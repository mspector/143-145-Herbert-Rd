# Incident: cured-in-place pipe liner blocked sewer pipe

## Status: resolved

- At no cost to us, Roto Rooter excavated the blocked sewer pipe to remove the malformed liner.
- In doing so, they destroyed about 20' of pipe between the entrance of the house and the public sewer.
- They replaced that pipe (again at no cost to us) and restored functionality.
- In the process, they removed the two large shrubs from the front lawn area.
- They plan to shoot the liner again today (2023-06-05).

Cost: $530.00 (1-800-got-junk shrub removal)

## Background

- Roto Rooter had previously replaced the house trap with a straight pipe connecting the house's plumbing line
  to the city's sewer.
- This enabled them to inspect the pipe between the house and the sewer with a snake camera.
- This inspection revealed that the pipe was in very poor condition 
  (breaks in the pipe joints, deeply eroded channels down the middle of the pipe, misaligned pipe segments, roots penetrating the pipe).
- They recommended a cured-in-place pipe liner, which we agreed to have installed.

## Timeline

**01 June 2023**
- Roto Rooter attempted the pipe liner installation on this day. They informed me that the pipe liner had cured much more quickly than expected, leaving no time for it to expand.
  This left the liner stuck in the pipe, blocking it completely.
- After informing me of the problem, the excavation manager Emir arrived onsite and explained to me that this was a rare occurrence, likely caused by the exceptional heat of the day (90 degrees F).
- Emir told me that the excavation team wouldn't be available until the next day, and asked that I book a hotel for two nights, to be reimbursed by Roto Rooter.
- We did so, and checked into the Marriott Residence Inn in Burlington.

**02 June 2023**
- The excavation team arrived in the morning. They attempted to remove the blockage by pulling on it from the inside of the house, to avoid having to excavate, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
- They informed me that they would need to use an excavator to remove the blocked pipe from the front of the house.
- Before doing so, they measured the angle of the pipes from inside the house to estimate the approximate excavation site.
- They noted that the likely location of the sewer pipe was directly beneath one of the large shrubs in the front of the house, which would need to be destroyed.
- One of the workmen noted that the shrub was overgrown and presented a risk of insects settling in/along the siding of the house. He recommended both be removed for that reason.
- They removed the shrub over the sewer line, and excavated until they reached the pipes. They discovered that the water line for the house lies very close to the sewer line,
  and exercised extra caution during the sewer line extraction.
- I left the site and did not observe the completion of the extraction.
- I received a call informing us that the plumbing would be functional again by the evening. It was too late to cancel the second night of the hotel, so we stayed there one more night.
- They informed me that they planned to return to attempt to shoot the pipe liner again on Monday (June 05).

**04 June 2023**
- 1-800-got-junk came to remove the excavated remains of the shrub.
- One of the shrubs still had a trunk and some of its root system buried in the ground. The 1-800-got-junk team helped me remove it.

**05 June 2023**
- The Roto Rooter team returned to re-attempt the pipe liner.
